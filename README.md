# ecommerce_data
This is a python data project that uses ecommerce data: Orders, Deliveries and Employee information to solve python coding challenges. These questions involve more intricate data relationships, optimization challenges, and strategic thinking. They require candidates to apply advanced Python programming skills, data manipulation techniques, and algorithmic approaches.
## 1. Inventory Update:
Introduce a new inventory dataset with product details and quantities. Create a function to update the inventory based on the orders and track the remaining quantity of each product.

## 2. Late Deliveries by Product:
Modify the dataset to include product delivery expectations. Implement a function that identifies late deliveries based on product delivery expectations and provides insights into the products most frequently associated with late deliveries.

## 3. Employee Scheduling Optimization:
Extend the employee dataset to include availability constraints and optimize the delivery schedule. Develop a function to assign deliveries to employees considering their working hours and availability.

## 4. Customer Loyalty Analysis:
Enhance the dataset to include customer feedback and loyalty information. Create a function to analyze customer satisfaction, identify loyal customers, and provide insights into factors influencing loyalty.

## 5. Dynamic Pricing Strategy:
Introduce dynamic pricing based on customer segments, order history, and product popularity. Design a function that calculates the total revenue, considering dynamic pricing, and provides recommendations for optimizing the pricing strategy.
